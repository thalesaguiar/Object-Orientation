## 1 Challenge
Kristen is a contender for valedictorian of her high school. She wants to know how many students (if any) have scored higher than her in the  exams given during this semester.

Most of the input is handled for you by the locked code in the editor.

In the void Student::input() function, you must read 5 scores from stdin and save them to your scores instance variable.

You have to print the number of students who had higher total marks than the Kristen.
